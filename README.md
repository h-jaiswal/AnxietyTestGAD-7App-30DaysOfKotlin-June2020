#About GAD-7 assessment for Anxiety - 

The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) is a seven-item instrument that is used to measure or assess the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Each item asks the individual to rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. Response options include “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “nearly every day”.

#Interpretation of Total Score generated by the app - 

Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.

When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.

Normative data for the GAD-7 were generated for boys and girls, and different age levels (see Löwe et al., 2008).

#Terms of use of GAD-7 

The GAD-7 is free to use. For more information see Pfizer's terms of use: https://www.phqscreeners.com/terms
